    <string name="app_description">
        After a few months of backpacking I came to realize that my life at home was quite repetitive and boring.
        (Even though I was living in a student town full of life)
        \n\nIn most peoples day-to-day life they perform repetitive and seemingly pointless tasks, I\'m sure you know what
        I\'m talking about. Repetitive tasks that we have grown to think that we like,
        things that take up a lot of our time but don\'t add anything to our lives.
        \n\nThe things that we wont remember when we grow old.
        \n\nI think that most people wouldn\'t even appreciate these parts of their lives if they had an easy
        option of doing something more exciting, something that will be worth remembering.
        \n\nThis is my attempt of giving you that option.
