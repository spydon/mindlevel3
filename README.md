## Description
In most peoples day-to-day life they perform repetitive and seemingly pointless tasks, I'm sure that you
can relate. Repetitive tasks that we have grown to think that we like, things that take up a lot of our time
but don't add anything to our lives.


The things that we wont remember when we grow old.
I think that most people wouldn't even appreciate these parts of their lives if they had an easy
option of doing something more exciting sometimes, something that would be worth remembering.

This is my attempt of giving you that option.
